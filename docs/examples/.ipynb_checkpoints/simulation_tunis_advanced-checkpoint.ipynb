In *pvpumpingsystem*, in the case of modeling a direct coupling with motor-pump, ``dc_model`` must be a single diode model, i.e. 'desoto' or 'cec'. In the present case, the spectral_model is turned off via 'no_loss'. This is because the TMY file retrieved with PVGIS does not contain comprehensive weather data (particularly the 'precipitable_water' column) which prevents from modeling the spectral modification of irradiance. Note that the losses model ``pvwatts`` is highly simplified and can also interfere in some cases with the accuracy of the direct coupling. It can be turned off with 'no_loss' as well, or can be kept as a conservative assumption on the power generation."

Four main categories of model were implemented in *pvpumpingsystem*, and can be called with the keywords 'kou', 'arab', 'hamidat' and 'theoretical'. References to the literature on which the functions rely are given in the corresponding function docstrings. The choice of a model can depend on the completeness of specifications or on the coupling chosen. For instance, 'hamidat' can only be used with an MPPT coupling, and 'theoretical' necessarily needs to have the ``motor_electrical_architecture`` parameter informed.

Remember as well that some of the information (ex: ``price``) can be read from the pump file and do not need to be explicitly defined as for ``pump_shurflo``."
