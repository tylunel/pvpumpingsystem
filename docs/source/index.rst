Welcome to pvpumpingsystem's documentation!
===========================================

*pvpumpingsystem* is a package providing tools for modeling and sizing
offgrid photovoltaic water pumping systems. It is specially designed for
small to medium size systems, the type of pumping system typically used
for isolated communities.

It can model the whole functioning of such pumping system on an hourly basis
and eventually provide key financial and technical findings on a year.
Conversely it can help choose some elements of the pumping station
depending on output values wanted (like daily water consumption and
acceptable risk of water shortage). Find more on the scope of the software
in the section :ref:`package_overview`.

The source code for pvpumpingsystem is hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/tylunel/pvpumpingsystem

The package was originally developped at T3E research group, in Ecole de
Technologie Superieure, Montreal, Qc, Canada, by Tanguy Lunel.

The software is published under the open source license GPL-v3.
