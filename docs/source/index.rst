Welcome to pvpumpingsystem's documentation!
===========================================

*pvpumpingsystem* is a package providing tools for modeling and sizing 
offgrid photovoltaic water pumping systems. It is specially designed for
small to medium size systems, the type of pumping system typically used
for isolated communities.

It allows to find the quantity of water pumped from the pumping station 
characteristics given, or to choose some elements of the pumping station 
depending on the consumption of water needed. It relies on pvlib-python 
for the photovoltaic power generation, and implements different models 
of pump for the simulation.

The source code for pvpumpingsystem is hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/tylunel/pvpumpingsystem

The package was originally developped at T3E research group, in Ecole de 
Technologie Superieure, Montreal, Qc, Canada, by Tanguy Lunel.

The software is published under the open source license GPL-v3.
